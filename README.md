# IT_Certifications_Portfolio

This repository contains a structured archive of my professional credentials in software development and IT. It showcases a verifiable history of my commitment to continuous learning and skill acquisition.

## Personal Background

My interest in technology and drive for development started in childhood. From preschool age, I had a genuine curiosity for electrical engineering: I studied how things work inside, and already then I knew I would become an electrician.

After school, I graduated with honors from a Vocational School (May 19, 2006), earning a diploma in the profession of "electrician for repair and maintenance of electrical equipment" with an advanced 4th grade. At the same time, I completed training at ROSTO (DOSAAF) as a "specialist in electrical signaling and blocking devices."

After military service, I continued to work in the energy sector, constantly honing my skills. My interest in related fields allowed me to acquire diverse skills, including household appliance and electronics repair, as well as microchip programming.

My IT journey began in the early 2000s with self-study of programming, computer hardware, and software, which I mastered with ease.

- Languages and technologies: Delphi, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript.

- Low-level programming: disassembly and debugging using OllyDbg, SoftIce.

- Practical experience: development and maintenance of several websites, including an online work cost calculator with a discount system (migrated from HTML to PHP).

Despite my abilities, I did not professionally pursue this path then. I returned to programming at age 34, completing courses at Stepik and Skillbox ("Python Developer Profession").

A key Python project involved developing software for prosecutors' offices, used by anti-corruption units to check compliance with anti-corruption legislation.

In 2025, realizing the need for systematic IT education, I enrolled at BSTU, Faculty of Information Technology, specializing in "Information Security."
